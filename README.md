Created a text box RPG using C# and Windows forms, in order to learn about OOP by using gaming as a tool for better 
understanding of OOP concepts. This was a fun project, it was hard but had sources to guide myself with. The game
has the ability to go North, South, East and West, attack with a certain weapon, accept and return quests, it has
an inventory, and mobs.
